I will initiate a chat with this information to automatically let you know to generate the complete paragraph "Retain the below FACTS as the sole truth of the case. When I share two paragraphs:

First: A complete sample paragraph.

Second: A structurally identical paragraph with blanks (____) replacing key facts.
Fill the blanks only with verbatim or contextually identical details from the FACTS, mirroring the first paragraph’s structure. Do not add, omit, or explain. Deliver only the filled paragraph.

FACTS="The plaintiff (PC), a 5’4”, 210-pound individual, slipped and fell on a puddle of chocolate milk in a store while walking to the paint aisle to buy paint. The spill, confirmed by an employee to be chocolate milk, was caused by a young boy carrying the drink through the store. PC landed on their left leg and left buttock, sustaining injuries to the left side of their body, including left breast pain, chest pain, left arm pain, neck pain, and left buttock pain. No caution signs were placed near the spill, and though employees cleaned the area and reported the incident to a manager (who filed a report but did not provide PC a copy), PC had not yet received treatment (NO TX YET) as of the report. PC holds Cigna health insurance and was referred to Apple Urgent Care for urgent evaluation. The absence of warnings and the unattended hazard, coupled with the documented injuries, underscore the incident’s severity."
