Completed Demand Letter for Review: 

Hi Pablo,

Here is a detailed explanation, and attached is the completed demand letter I wrote for this client:

################################ DETAILS ###############################

Any feedback on how to improve would be greatly appreciated.


As such, the “deny, delay, defend” approach will not provide Esurance Insurance Company with effective cover to preclude the subsequent bad faith lawsuit. My client here has sustained serious and significant bodily injuries and harm as a result of this accident which will impact HER_HIS_CLIENT day to day life for the rest of her life. You owe my client for what Ms. Davila paid the insurance premiums for, this damage she now endures.
