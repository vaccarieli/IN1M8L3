Questions & Doubts

- Are demands drafted and sent each time a new medical record is available? (Just out of curiosity)
- Still unclear on how to calculate the amount for Future Medical Expenses, Past Pain & Suffering/Emotional Distress, Future Pain & Suffering/Emotional Distress. What I am doing is just based on common sense considering how much time I have working for the firm.

Prompts:

I need to specify on the demand draft the client's Diagnosis: "What was diagnosed.", Procedures:"What they did about it", and Future Procedures. I have to go thru the records MREC and MBILL to find that information. Here is the document I have for the MREC.

Reminders:

- Ask about transportation.

Positive Phrases:
I made some progress
I went ahead and worked
I took the initiative
